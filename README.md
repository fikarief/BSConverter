## BSConverter

BSConverter is a simple app designed to simulate bisulfite conversion on DNA sequences. During bisulfite treatment, cytosine bases (C) are chemically converted into thymine (T), except when they are followed by a guanine (G) â€” the CpG sites remain unchanged.

Because of this conversion, the forward (positive) and reverse (negative) DNA strands are no longer perfectly complementary. BSConverter processes the input DNA sequence and allows you to download both the forward and reverse bisulfite-converted sequences for downstream analysis.


## How to use
Save the DNA sequence into .txt file and upload it. This app doesn't support multiple input such as .fasta, you can convert one sequence at the time.
